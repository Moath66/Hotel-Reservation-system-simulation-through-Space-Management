# Hotel Reservation System Simulation

## About
The **Hotel Reservation System Simulation** is a Java-based project that demonstrates proficiency in **object-oriented programming** and **problem-solving** for real-world applications. This system allows customers to easily manage their hotel bookings, ensuring an intuitive and seamless user experience. With its efficient algorithms and well-designed user interface, this system provides a solid foundation for simulating hotel room reservations and managing space.

## Features
- **Customer Booking Management**: Customers can make, modify, and cancel their room bookings.
- **Room Availability**: The system displays available rooms in real time, showing current occupancy and available space.
- **Booking History**: Allows users to view their past reservations and related details.
- **Intuitive User Interface**: Simple and easy-to-use interface for booking, canceling, and reviewing reservations.
- **Space Management**: Efficient algorithms handle the allocation and deallocation of rooms based on customer requests.
- **Real-Time Updates**: When a reservation is made or canceled, the system updates the availability of rooms in real time.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: The core programming language used for implementing the object-oriented concepts and algorithms in this project.
- **Swing**: Used for developing the graphical user interface (GUI) to make the system interactive and user-friendly.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: The system is designed using classes and objects to represent customers, rooms, bookings, and other system components.
- **Algorithms**: Utilizes efficient algorithms to manage room availability and ensure quick responses for customer actions.

### Prerequisites
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or later.
- **IDE**: Any Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) or a simple text editor.
